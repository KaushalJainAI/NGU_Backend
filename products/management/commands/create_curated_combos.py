"""
Create a set of curated, recipe-sensible combos for the Nidhi Masala catalog.

The combos were designed from the live catalog, the pushponline.com combo
lineup (Kitchen Favourites box, Sprinkler combo, Chilli/Kashmiri combo, etc.)
and standard Indian-recipe logic (everyday tadka staples, chole base, pickle
kit, masala chai, papad set).

Pricing is COMPUTED from current catalog prices so it stays correct in any
environment:
  * combo.price          = sum of each item's regular (MRP) price  -> strike-through
  * combo.discount_price = a bundle deal a notch below the sum of the items'
                           current selling prices, rounded to a tidy ...9 ending.

Products are matched by a name fragment (case-insensitive). When a fragment
matches several products, an exact full-name match wins (so "Chana Masala"
resolves to the masala, not "Chana Masala Papad"). Idempotent: combos that
already exist (by name) are skipped.
