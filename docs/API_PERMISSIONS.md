## Data Access Control (BOLA Protection)

Users can only access their own:
- **Cart** — One cart per user
- **Orders** — Only their own orders
- **Favorites** — Their saved products
- **Profile** — Their own profile only
- **Assistant Conversations** — Scoped to user ID or anonymous session ID

Admins (`is_staff=True`) can access all data.

---

## Special Permissions

### Review Verification
- Users can only review products from **delivered** orders
- Reviews are marked `is_verified_purchase=True`

### Order Access
- Regular users: Own orders only
- Admins: All orders (for management)

### AI Assistant
- Anonymous users: product Q&A and navigation only; cart/order tools return a login-required message
- Authenticated users: full access to cart-query and order-status tools

---

## Security Notes

1. **Receivable Accounts** — Admin-only to protect payment collection details
2. **Dashboard** — Admin-only to protect business metrics
3. **JWT Tokens** — 1 hour access, 7 day refresh
4. **Password Hashing** — Django's PBKDF2 with SHA256
5. **CORS** — Configured for specific origins only
